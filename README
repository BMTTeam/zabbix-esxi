The template is the same as Template Virt VMware Hypervisor but with all {HOST.HOST} variables replaces by {$UUID}

Import this template to your templates inventory.
Create an host for your ESXi hypervisor. You don't need any agent/ipmi/snmp interfaces.
Link the host to this template.
Creates 4 macros :
  {$URL}      -> https://esxi.hostname/sdk 
  {$USERNAME} -> any esxi user that have at least readonly access (recommended for obvious security reason)
  {$PASSWORD} -> the user's password
  {$UUID}     -> esxi host UUID

*How to obtain ESXi UUID*
0. You need to enable MOB vib, esxcli does not seems to provide the valid uuid for this.
1. enable MOB vib : Go to you're vsphere Advanced Settings, Config, Hostagent, plugins, solo, check "Config.HostAgent.plugins.solo.enableMob"
2. Browse to https://esxi.hostname/mob/?moid=ha-host&doPath=hardware.systemInfo
3. disable MOB vib again (uncheck Config.HostAgent.plugins.solo.enableMob)
